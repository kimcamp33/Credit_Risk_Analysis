# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose 

The purpose of this task is to utilize machine learning to resolve the challenge of credit card risk. This data will help banks predict risk and alleviate extending risky loans.  

## Results 

Several techiniques were used which include Oversampling, Undersampling, and Combination sampling 

Naive Random Oversampling = 53% accuracy rate
SMOTE Oversampling = 63.6% accuracy rate
Undersampling = 53% accuracy rate
Combination Sampling = 65% accuracy rate


## Summary 

While no technique may be 100%, the best technique to use the combination because it provides the highest accuracy rate.
